# **Cohort-Based Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis and Prediction**

## Overview
This project analyzes **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using cohort-based segmentation. The goal is to track customer behavior over time, measure retention, and predict future revenue per customer. The entire analysis is performed using **SQL for data extraction and transformation**, with **Spreadsheets (Google Sheets)** for visualization.

## üîç Key Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**  
   - Extracting transactional data using SQL  

2. **Cohort Segmentation**  
   - Grouping customers based on their first purchase month  
   - Calculating retention rates across different time periods  

3. **Revenue and CLV Calculation**  
   - Computing average order value per user (AOV)  
   - Estimating churn rates and revenue decay  

4. **Predicting Future CLV**  
   - Using historical trends to forecast customer value  
   - Applying retention-based revenue projections  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **SQL** (BigQuery) for data processing  
- **Google Sheets** for cohort visualization and forecasting

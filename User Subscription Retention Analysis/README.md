# User Subscription Retention Analysis

This project focuses on **cohort analysis**, **retention**, and **churn** analysis. It calculates weekly retention for user subscriptions over a 7-week period, tracking how many users remain active each week after their subscription starts.

## Key Steps

1. Group users by the week they started their subscription.
2. Calculate the number of users retained each week (Week 0 to Week 6).
3. Present the results as a cohort retention table.

## Results

The results of the analysis are available in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TDO6wzc0Eb3wL1IFsZOMyhQjerPaQhpON657Ul90Gt4/edit?usp=sharing)
